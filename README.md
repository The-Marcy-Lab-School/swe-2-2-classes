## Reminders

### Asking ChatGPT for Help

If you’re stuck, you may use ChatGPT to clarify the assignment — but not to solve it for you. To do this, copy the meta-prompt below into ChatGPT along with the assignment question.

> You are acting as a tutor. Your job is to explain what this coding question is asking, clarify confusing wording, and highlight the relevant concepts students need to know — but do not provide the full solution or code that directly answers the question. Instead, focus on rephrasing the problem in simpler terms, identifying what’s being tested, and suggesting what steps or thought processes might help. Ask guiding questions to ensure the student is thinking critically. Do not write the final function, algorithm, or code implementation.

Be mindful of your AI usage on assignments. AI can be a great tool to help your learning but it can also be detrimental if you let it do too much of the thinking for you.

### Be Okay With Being "Provisionally Complete"

At Marcy, we will deem an assignment as "complete" if the solution passes at least **75%** of the automated tests. 

However, we know many of you will feel the urge to hold off on submitting until your assignment feels 100% perfect. That drive for excellence is an asset!

But perfectionism can also get in the way of learning — especially when we need to cover a lot in a short amount of time.

That’s why we encourage you to be comfortable with being **“provisionally complete.”** This means:

- Submitting your work even if it isn’t perfect yet
- Treating submission as a checkpoint, not a finish line
- Committing to return, revise, and improve later

Learning to move forward with provisional completeness will help you make steady progress while still building the habit of continuous improvement.

## Setup

For guidance on setting up and submitting this assignment, refer to the Marcy lab School Docs How-To guide for [Working with Short Response and Coding Assignments](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/how-tos/working-with-assignments#how-to-work-on-assignments).

Here are some useful commands to remember.

```sh
npm i                   # install dependencies
git checkout -b draft   # switch to the draft branch before starting

npm test # run the automated tests
npm run test:w # run the automated tests and rerun them each time you save a change

git add -A              # add a changed file to the staging area
git commit -m 'message' # create a commit with the changes
git push                # push the new commit to the remote repo
```

## Short Response Questions

Short response questions can be found in the `src/short-response.md` file. Write your responses directly in that file! Do not forget to complete this part of the assignment.

### Prompt 1

With OOP in JavaScript, it's possible to use factory functions to achieve encapsulation and re-use them to make objects that look alike. However, factory functions have drawbacks and we often use classes instead.

How would you explain to a budding developer what the drawbacks of using factory functions are and why it is better to use classes instead?

### Prompt 2

Explain what factors you should consider when deciding to make a property/method private? Provide an example to support your response.

### Prompt 3

Explain what factors you should consider when deciding to make a property/method static? Provide an example to support your response.

### Prompt 4

The code below was generated by AI and contains a logical error.

```js
class Vault {
  #secrets = [];
  addSecret(newSecret) {
    this.#secrets.push(newSecret);
  }
  listSecrets() {
    return this.#secrets;
  }
}
```

Identify what the mistake is, explain why it is a problem, and suggest a way to fix it.

## From Scratch

### Question 1 - Rectangle

Create a class `Rectangle`.

The `Rectangle()` constructor accepts two parameters: 
- `length` (number)
- `width` (string)

Instance methods:
- `getArea` — returns the area of the rectangle (length * width)
- `getPerimeter` — returns the perimeter of the rectangle (sum of all four sides)
- `isSquare` — returns `true` if the rectangle is a square, `false` if not

Example Usage:
```js
const myShape = new Rectangle(10, 5); // length = 10, width = 5
console.log(myShape.getArea()); // 50
console.log(myShape.getPerimeter()); // 30 (10 * 2 + 5 * 2)
console.log(myShape.isSquare()); // false

// length and width are public properties so we can mutate them
myShape.width = 3;
myShape.length = 3;
console.log(myShape.getArea()); // 9
console.log(myShape.getPerimeter()); // 12
console.log(myShape.isSquare()); // true
```

### Question 2 - Car

Create a class `Vehicle`.

The `Vehicle()` constructor accepts two parameters:
- `type` (string)
- `capacity` (number)

The `Vehicle()` constructor also accepts a third optional parameter:
- `color` (initialize to `"black"`)

Default instance properties:
- `passengers` (initialize to an empty array)

Instance methods:
- `paint(color)` — updates the vehicle's color and returns the new color.
- `addPassenger(passenger)` — adds a passenger to the vehicle and returns the number of passengers. If the capacity is full, do not add the passenger and instead return `-1`;

Example Usage:
```js
const bus = new Vehicle('School Bus', 48, 'yellow');
console.log(bus.color); // yellow

const motorcycle = new Vehicle('Motorcycle', 2);
console.log(motorcycle.color); // black

console.log(motorcycle.addPassenger('Bonnie')); // 1
console.log(motorcycle.addPassenger('Clyde')); // 2
console.log(motorcycle.addPassenger('Toto')); // -1 (not enough capacity, not added)

console.log(motorcycle.passengers); // ['Bonnie', 'Clyde']
```

### Question 3 — PasswordManager

Create a class `PasswordManager` that manages a private password (string).

The `PasswordManager()` constructor accepts one parameter:
- `password` (string)

Instance methods:
- `checkPassword(attempt)` — compares the provided `attempt` with the private password. Returns `true` if they match, `false` otherwise.
- `setPassword(oldPassword, newPassword)` — compares the provided `oldPassword` with the private password. If they match, updates the private password to the provided `newPassword` and returns `true`. Otherwise, returns `false`.

Example Usage:

```js

const myPW = new PasswordManager('abc');
console.log(myPW.checkPassword('abc')); // true
console.log(myPW.checkPassword('blah')); // false

console.log(myPW.setPassword('blah', 'foobar')); // false
console.log(myPW.setPassword('abc', 'foobar')); // true

console.log(myPW.checkPassword('foobar')); // true
```

### Question 4 — TodoList

Create a class `TodoList` that manages a private array of todo items (strings).

The `TodoList()` constructor accepts one parameter:
- `title` (string)

Instance methods:
- `addItem(description)` — adds a new item to the list of items with the given description and returns the new length of the list.
- `removeItem(description)` — finds and removes the item from the list that matches the description and returns the removed item. If an item with a matching description is not found, return `null` instead.
- `getItems()` — returns a copy of the private items array.

Example Usage:

```js
const groceryList = new TodoList('groceries');
console.log(groceryList.getItems()); // []

console.log(groceryList.addItem('bread'));  // 1
console.log(groceryList.addItem('milk'));   // 2
console.log(groceryList.addItem('eggs'));   // 3
console.log(groceryList.getItems()); // ['bread', 'milk', 'eggs']

console.log(groceryList.removeItem('milk'));   // milk
console.log(groceryList.removeItem('cheese')); // null
console.log(groceryList.getItems()); // ['bread', 'eggs']

// Get a copy of the internal array
const items = groceryList.getItems();
items.length = 0;

// The internal array is not affected by the previous statement
console.log(groceryList.getItems()); // ['bread', 'eggs'] 
```

### Question 5 - BankAccount

Create a class `BankAccount` that manages a private balance (a number). The `BankAccount` class should also keep a private total of the balances across all instances.

The `BankAccount()` constructor accepts two parameters:
- `firstName` (string)
- `lastName` (string)

The `BankAccount()` constructor also accepts a third optional parameter:
- `balance` (defaults to `0`, sets an initial value for the private balance)

Instance methods:
- `deposit(amount)` — adds the amount to the balance and returns a message of the balance `Your balance is $[new balance].00`
- `withdraw(amount)` — subtracts the amount from the balance and returns a message of the balance `Your balance is $[new balance].00`. If the given amount to withdraw is greater than the balance, do not subtract the balance and instead return `You do not have enough funds.`

Static methods:
- `getTotalHoldings()` — returns the total balance across all `BankAccount` instances

Example Usage:

```js
const account1 = new BankAccount('Alan', 'Turing'); // starts with 0 balance
const account2 = new BankAccount('Ada', 'Lovelace', 100); // starts with 100 balance

console.log(account1.deposit(50));    // prints "Your new balance is $50.00"
console.log(account1.deposit(20.5));  // prints "Your new balance is $70.50"
console.log(account1.withdraw(10));   // prints "Your new balance is $60.50"
console.log(account1.withdraw(100));  // prints "You do not have enough funds"

console.log(BankAccount.getTotalHoldings()); // prints 160.50
```
